# The Top 10 Computer Vision Papers of 2021
## The top 10 computer vision papers in 2021 with video demos, articles, code, and paper reference.

While the world is still recovering, research hasn't slowed its frenetic pace, especially in the field of artificial intelligence. More, many important aspects were highlighted this year, like the ethical aspects, important biases, governance, transparency and much more. Artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human brain and its link to AI are constantly evolving, showing promising applications improving our life's quality in the near future. Still, we ought to be careful with which technology we choose to apply.

>"Science cannot tell us what we ought to do, only what we can do."<br/>- Jean-Paul Sartre, Being and Nothingness

Here are my top 10 of the most interesting research papers of the year in computer vision, in case you missed any of them. In short, it is basically a curated list of the latest breakthroughs in AI and CV with a clear video explanation, link to a more in-depth article, and code (if applicable). Enjoy the read, and let me know if I missed any important papers in the comments, or by contacting me directly on LinkedIn!

The complete reference to each paper is listed at the end of this repository.

üëÄ **If you'd like to support my work** and use W&B (for free) to track your ML experiments and make your work reproducible or collaborate with a team, you can try it out by following [this guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb)! Since most of the code here is PyTorch-based, we thought that a [QuickStart guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb) for using W&B on PyTorch would be most interesting to share.

üëâFollow [this quick guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Simple_PyTorch_Integration.ipynb), use the same W&B lines in your code or any of the repos below, and have all your experiments automatically tracked in your w&b account! It doesn't take more than 5 minutes to set up and will change your life as it did for me! [Here's a more advanced guide](https://colab.research.google.com/github/louisfb01/examples/blob/master/colabs/pytorch/Organizing_Hyperparameter_Sweeps_in_PyTorch_with_W%26B.ipynb) for using Hyperparameter Sweeps if interested :)

## Total Relighting: Learning to Relight Portraits for Background Replacement¬†[5]<a name="5"></a>
Properly relight any portrait based on the lighting of the new background you add. Have you ever wanted to change the background of a picture but have it look realistic? If you‚Äôve already tried that, you already know that it isn‚Äôt simple. You can‚Äôt just take a picture of yourself in your home and change the background for a beach. It just looks bad and not realistic. Anyone will just say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs photoshopped‚Äù in a second. For movies and professional videos, you need the perfect lighting and artists to reproduce a high-quality image, and that‚Äôs super expensive. There‚Äôs no way you can do that with your own pictures. Or can you?

## Animating Pictures with Eulerian Motion Fields¬†[6]<a name="6"></a>
This model takes a picture, understands which particles are supposed to be moving, and realistically animates them in an infinite loop while conserving the rest of the picture entirely still creating amazing-looking videos like this one...

## (Style)CLIPDraw: Coupling Content and Style in Text-to-Drawing Synthesis¬†[9]<a name="9"></a>
Have you ever dreamed of taking the style of a picture, like this cool TikTok drawing style on the left, and applying it to a new picture of your choice? Well, I did, and it has never been easier to do. In fact, you can even achieve that from only text and can try it right now with this new method and their Google Colab notebook available for everyone (see references). Simply take a picture of the style you want to copy, enter the text you want to generate, and this algorithm will generate a new picture out of it! Just look back at the results above, such a big step forward! The results are extremely impressive, especially if you consider that they were made from a single line of text!

## CityNeRF: Building NeRF at City Scale¬†[10]<a name="10"></a>
The model is called CityNeRF and grows from NeRF, which I previously covered on my channel. NeRF is one of the first models using radiance fields and machine learning to construct 3D models out of images. But NeRF is not that efficient and works for a single scale. Here, CityNeRF is applied to satellite and ground-level images at the same time to produce various 3D model scales for any viewpoint. In simple words, they bring NeRF to city-scale. But how?
